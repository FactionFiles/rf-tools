makevbm
=======

This is a simple clone of makeVBM tool from official RF Toolkit.

Original tool had troubles to handle files with high resolutions. This clone does not have this limitation.
As a bonus this tool is capable of reading many common image formats, not only Targa (tga). Detailed list of
supported formats can be found at https://crates.io/crates/image
